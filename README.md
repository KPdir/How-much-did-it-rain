# How-much-did-it-rain - Competetion-II

This repository contains the code and presentation used for the talk at Learn Data Science meetup Vancouver on June 30 2016.
I have put together this material to take us through the competetion by talking about the data, my small attempt at a solution and then discussing the winner's apporach to the problem. 

- You will find the code used for this talk in the file "[eda_howmuchrain.Rmd](https://github.com/KPdir/How-much-did-it-rain/blob/master/eda_howmuchrain.Rmd)"
